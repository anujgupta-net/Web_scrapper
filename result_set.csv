I took a parcel from this outlet on my recent visit to my native place. Ordered 3 mc aloo tikki burgers and one medium fries. The burger was nicely done as usual, the bun was soft and tikki was superb in taste. The fried were also nicely done and were not oily.

The packing for burgers was properly done and had paper napkins and sauce sachets in it, however the fries were packed in the regular serving paper pouch which is served at all the outlets, it was kept as it is in the parcel bag because of which some fries came out of it. I think the packing for the fries should be done in a spill proof box.

Visiting A Mall And Not Eating At The McDonalds sounds a bore. So we tried to sound cliche. Also to try the discontinued Filet-O-Fish Burger At Chennai Outlets.

Dishes Ordered ‚Äî
1) Filet-O-Fish Meal ~ This Filet-O-Fish Burger is heaven. The Fish Pattice is just on point and the Fries With Coke Only Complement. Pick Of The EATOut.
2) Veg McPuff ~ Nicely Made Puff with usual Paneer and veggies stuff.
3) McEgg ~ The Pattice is like double cooked Hakf Boil Egg. Another Decent Burger.
4) McAloo Tikki ~ Very Fresh and essence of Aloo Tikki is also there.

Ambience ~ Usual McDonalds Type Set Up.
Worth For The Price ~ Worth it for the quantity.
Location Accessiblity ~ Is Located On Lower Ground Of Mall.
Service ~ Self Service.
Hygiene ~ Yes,it‚Äôs hygiene.
Washroom ~ Washroom is Of mall.
